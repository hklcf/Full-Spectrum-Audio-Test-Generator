# Full Spectrum Audio Test Generator

## Description

The Full Spectrum Audio Test Generator is a web-based tool designed for audio testing and experimentation. It generates audio signals across the entire audible spectrum and beyond, from infrasonic to ultrasonic frequencies (1 Hz to 24,000 Hz). This tool is ideal for audio enthusiasts, sound engineers, and researchers interested in exploring various audio frequencies and waveforms.

## Features

- Frequency range: 1 Hz to 24,000 Hz
- Multiple waveform options: Sine, Square, Sawtooth, and Triangle waves
- Real-time frequency and volume adjustment
- Informative frequency descriptions
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).
3. Select the desired waveform type.
4. Adjust the frequency using the slider (1 Hz to 24,000 Hz).
5. Set the volume level.
6. Click "Start Test" to begin audio playback, and click again to stop.
7. Observe the frequency information for details about the current frequency characteristics.

## Safety Warning

⚠️ **CAUTION**: This tool can generate high-frequency and high-volume sounds. Please use with care:

- Start with low volume settings and increase gradually.
- Be especially careful when using headphones.
- Avoid prolonged exposure to high frequencies or high volumes.
- If you experience any discomfort, stop the test immediately.
